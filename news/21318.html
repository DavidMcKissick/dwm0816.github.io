          <p class="storyContent">Today we have officially launched our funding campaign! <br> With this we have officially begun on the trail to our long term goal of spreading awareness on a rather enshrouded disease. <br><br> We just want to thank anyone considering donating and those that have taken the time to look into us for your interest. Without curious people such as yourself we wouldn't be where we are today, so thank you. For your time and curiousity. Today we are asking you for your assistance in achieving our dream of raising awareness and spreading even a modicum of hope
          in a world where documentation and coverage is dangerously low. We are campaigning today to take our first leap into the
          unknown. With your donations we can form our 501c3 charity and begin on our life long mission of raising awareness and providing
          assistance to those that truly and wholly need it. <br><br> Today we are asking for a chance.</p>
